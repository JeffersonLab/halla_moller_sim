Please add a list of things to do (high priority place at top): 

_X_ : Incorporate Levchuck effect into Messenger/Macro.

_X_ : Levchuck effect needs to be initialized to a default value of "1" 
    when not used.

___ : There are a couple of FIXME's left to be addressed.

___ : Incorporate macro/messenger command to turn off G4MSC

___ : Dial back the energy to 1GeV

___ : Incorporate macro to turn radiative corrections on and off

___ : After radiative corrections are turned off we should be able to fix the 
      COM scattering angle and be able to observe the width of the smear from LE.

___ : Target width should be ideally 10 microns.
