MolPol installation and running instructions

---------------------------------------------------
Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.10
cmake > 2.6
root

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to MolPol>
make


It just needs to be downloaded and for the example, present in the directory
you are running in.  Otherwise, specify it in the macro as in the
exmaple provided in macros/  An example macro will be found in

macros/runexmaple.mac

To run in batch mode, execute with a macro such as:

./MolPol runexample.mac

Ensure that all macros include a /run/initialization command or else they will
not work.

==== Visualization ===============

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./MolPol

which should bring up a graphical command interface

To see the geometry:

/control/execute macros/vis.mac


==== Using TOSCA Field Maps =======

Usage of TOSCA fields specified by MagSourceMode '2'

NOTE: Currently the TOSCA version runs only in mode '2'. In order for to accommodate
      ideal field volumes and field maps the geometry needs to be rebuilt. This doesn't
      seem to be a problem other than potential danglers with the geometry.  However, this
      does mean that the MagSourceMode type would have to be sent to the FieldSetup via it's
      construction inside DetectorConstruction.

Macros are set as such:

/field/MagSourceMode      2
/field/setToscaQ1         TOSCA/Q1_map_1011G.table         1.011       -6.5
/field/setToscaQ2         TOSCA/Q2_map_6146G.table         6.146       -6.0
/field/setToscaQ3         TOSCA/Q1_map_1011G.table         1.011       2.5
/field/setToscaQ4         TOSCA/Q1_map_1011G.table         1.011       5.1
/field/setToscaQ5         TOSCA/lilly_map_3.0kG.table      3.0         11.9
/field/setToscaQ6         none
/field/update

To set fields the macro must be structured as:

/field/setTOSCAQx    <relative file loc> <field tip strength of tosca file> <desired field tip strength for sim>

And, to deactivate a field you can use the 'none' option.

/field/setTOSCAQx         none

NOTE: The command /field/update MUST BE RUN in order to activate field

NOTE: Previous fields macro entries are saved.  So, if you want to update one field
that's all you have to do.
