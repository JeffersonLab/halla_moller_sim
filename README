MolPol installation and running instructions

---------------------------------------------------
Packages to build this:

>=Geant4.10
cmake > 2.6
root

---------------------------------------------------

Instructions:

To build, create the directory you would like to
build in, say build

mkdir build
cd build
cmake <path to MolPol>
make


It just needs to be downloaded and for the example, present in the directory
you are running in.  Otherwise, specify it in the macro as in the
exmaple provided in macros/  An example macro will be found in

macros/runexmaple.mac

To run in batch mode, execute with a macro such as:

./MolPol runexample.mac

Ensure that all macros include a /run/initialization command or else they will
not work.

==== Visualization ===============

Visualization macros are found in vis/

To run, execute

./MolPol

which should bring up a graphical command interface

To see the geometry:

/control/execute macros/vis.mac


==== Using TOSCA Field Maps =======

Usage of TOSCA fields specified by MagSourceMode '2'

Macros are set as such:

/field/setToscaQ1         TOSCA/q1_6.47kG.table        1.2745    75.19
/field/setToscaQ2         TOSCA/q2_6.145kG.table       1.1765   104.46
/field/setToscaQ3         TOSCA/q1_6.47kG.table       -0.4902   209.59
/field/setToscaQ4         TOSCA/q1_6.47kG.table       -1.       274.59
/field/setToscaQ5         TOSCA/lilly_119kG.table     -1.       422.80
/field/setToscaQ6         none
/field/Update

To set fields the macro must be structured as:

/field/setTOSCAQx         <relative file location>    <scaling for file>    <z-offset of file>

And, to deactivate a field you can use the 'none' option.

/field/setTOSCAQx         none

NOTE: The command /field/update MUST BE RUN in order to activate field

NOTE: Previous fields macro entries are saved.  So, if you want to update one field
that's all you have to do.
